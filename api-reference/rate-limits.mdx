<Info>
Rate limiting helps ensure fair usage and protects against abuse while maintaining optimal API performance for all users.

## How Rate Limiting Works

  <Card title="Plan-Based Limits" icon="crown">
    Limits are determined by your subscription plan (Startup vs Standard).

  <Card title="IP-Based Limits" icon="location-dot">
    Unauthenticated requests are limited by IP address to prevent abuse.

### Rate Limiting Factors

Rate limits are primarily determined by your **API Access Token**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Subscription Plan (Authenticated)">
    Your rate limit depends on your active subscription plan:
    - **Free Plan**: 10 requests / minute
    - **Startup Plan**: 100 requests / minute
    - **Standard Plan**: 1,000 requests / minute
    - **Enterprise**: Custom limits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Source IP Address (Unauthenticated)">
    For requests without an API token (or if the token is invalid), limits are applied per source IP address to prevent abuse.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specific Resources">
    Critical endpoints such as License Key validation and activation may have additional protective limits to maintain system integrity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Callout type="info">
Authenticated requests are counted against your **Plan Limit**, not your IP limit. This allows you to deploy your application to many users without hitting IP-based restrictions.
</Callout>

## Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API responds with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTP Response">
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    Content-Type: application/json
    Retry-After: 60
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JSON Response">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Too many requests. Please upgrade your plan for higher limits.",
      "code": 3
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Handling 429 Too Many Requests

1. **Check Your Plan**: Ensure your current plan supports your application's traffic volume. You may need to upgrade to **Standard** or **Enterprise**.
2. **Implement Exponential Backoff**:
   - Wait for a short period (e.g., 1 second) before retrying.
   - If the request fails again, double the wait time.
3. **Cache Responses**: Reduce API calls by caching license validation results locally.

<Callout type="tip">
If you consistently encounter rate limits, consider upgrading your plan to increase your allowance from 100/min to 1,000/min or higher.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use an Access Token">
    Always include your API Key in the `Authorization` header. Unauthenticated requests have very low rate limits.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
    When you receive a 429 response, wait progressively longer between retries.
    
    ```javascript
    async function retryWithBackoff(apiCall, maxRetries = 3) {
      for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        try {
          return await apiCall();
        } catch (error) {
          if (error.status === 429 && i < maxRetries - 1) {
            const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
            continue;
          }
          throw error;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cache API Responses">
    Reduce API calls by caching responses when appropriate.
  </Step>
